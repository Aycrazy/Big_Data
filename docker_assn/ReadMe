Docker ML ReadMe

Contents include:
    - Jupyter-notebook file created using "basic use" instructions of the jupyter/pyspark-notebook docker image that builds the multinomial logistic regression notebook
    - docker-compose yml file
    - docker container directories: api and web
        - Two small flask apps (one a web app, and one an api that listens to port 5000)
        - Api loads a trained multinomial logistic regression model and uses it to predict probabilities for flower species

1) Unzip the docker_assn zip   

2) Inside the main "docker_assn" directory run docker-compose up

3) Go to your http://localhost:8000 (or 0.0.0.0:8000)

4) Input the dimensions of your flower -- This will take you to the result page, where you will view the probability that your flower is one of three species based on the use of a pyspark (MLLib) multinomial logistic regression.

5) If you want to check the probabilities of a different flower go back to http://localhost:8000
